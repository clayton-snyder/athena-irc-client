<WIP>

This program uses [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
to format terminal output. While all modern terminal emulators support these
(including Windows Terminal), the classic Windows Console Host does not, and I'm
not planning to implement a translation layer to support it. Thankfully, the
classic Windows Console is gradually being phased out in favor of Windows
Terminal, which is already the default terminal program in Windows 11.
